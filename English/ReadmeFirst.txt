You find attached drawings showing the footprint of many cycles.
The shapes are based upon existing cycles and you also find a spreadsheet listing cycles used to build this document and their dimensions. 
The footprint views are numbered.
The realisation of this compilation was triggered by the installation in my country (France) of many motorist access prevention equipment (baffles), supposed to block not only cars, but motorbikes and moped. However, attempting (without success) to block motorised two wheelers, they also block many kind of cycles and all trailer equipped bikes. Some equipment even requires dismantling panniers to go through. They are effectively preventing the use of bike path by many legitimate users and are a real nuisance, and in addition the most complex access prevention system costs a lot of money.
The purpose of this compilation is to define what space is required to allow passage of cycles and trailer equipped cycles.
A simple enveloping shape was defined, in order to check that passage on bike ways is possible.
If some bikes cannot pass, the references of cycle type which cannot go through can be listed for the given bottleneck.
